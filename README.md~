# smolny
This is public repository for our smolny works. 
I suggest each of you to create you own folder and commit your code there. 
First clone repository to your working directory (of course you should have git stalled before=)

#clone repo to local host
git clone https://github.com/psychoveter/smolny.git

#commit to local repository
git commit -m "this is comment"
#push local changes to global repository
git push 

#nice tutorial on git for future
